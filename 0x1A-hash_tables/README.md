## What is a hash function
A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size
to fixed-size values known as hashes. Hashes are values returned by a hash
function which are index values for a fixed-size table called a hash table.
This process of using a hash function to index a hash table is known as
hashing.

Hash functions rely on generating favourable probability distributions for
their effectiveness, reducing access time to nearly constant.
## What makes a good hash function
A good hash function satisfies two basic properties:
- It should be very fast to compute
- It should minimize duplication of output values (collision)
