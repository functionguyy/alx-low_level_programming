# 0x12. C- Singly linked lists
A linked consist of a chain of `struct` type elements called nodes. Each node
contains a pointer to the next node in the chain.

The pointer in the last node in a linked list is a pointer to `NULL` or
in other word a `NULL` pointer. 

A linked list is more flexible than an array because you can easily insert and delete nodes
in a linked list allowing the list to grow and shrink as needed. 

Although unlike an array which any of its element can be accessed with the
same speed, accessing a node in a linked list is fast if the node is close to the
beginning of the list and slow if it's near the end.

## DECLARING A NODE TYPE
To set up a linked list, the first thing you will need is a structure that
represents a single node in the list. Lets assume that a node contains a
character pointer, unsigned int and a pointer to the next node in the list.
The structure of the node we look like this:
```C
struct node 
{
	char *str;  /* Data stored in the node */
	unsigned int len; /*Data stored in the node */
	struct node *next; /* pointer to the next node in the list */
}
```
when a structure has a member that points to its same kind of structure just like
`struct node` does, you are required to use a **structure tag**.

But you can also use `typedef` name to create the above `struct` like this:
```C
typdef struct node
{
	char *str;   /* Data stored in the node */
	unsigned int len; /* Data stored in the node */
	struct node *next; /* pointer to the next node in the list */ 
} list_t;
```

One advantage of a linked list is that nodes can be added at any point 
in the list. But adding nodes at the beginning of the list is the easiest
method.

Once a structure of a node is declared, you'll need a way to keep track of
where the list begins. In other words, you'll need a pointer variable that always
points to the first node in the list. 

For `struct node` we can create this pointer variable like this:
```C
struct node *head; /* head points to a structure of type struct node */

/* Since we don't have any nodes in the list yet, we can set the pointer to
 * point to a NULL address
 */

head = NULL;
```
Setting the pointer variable `head` to `NULL` indicates that the list is
intially empty.

## CREATING A NODE
To construct a linked list, you will need to create a node and then add the node you have 
created to the list and then repeat the same process the on and on till you have
created and added the total amount of nodes that you want in the linked list. 

Creating a node requires three steps:
- Allocate memory on the heap for the node
- Store data in the node
- insert the node into the list

When you create a node, you'll need a pointer variable that can point to the node
temporarily, until it has been inserted into the list. Then you can use `malloc`
to allocate memory for the new node and save the address returned by the
`malloc` operation in the pointer variable

```C
struct node *new_node;
```


### 3-add_node_end.c
To add a new node to the end of a linked list, you have to first set the
pointer to the next node memeber in the new node to `NULL` then check that the current
head of the linked list is not a `NULL` pointer once that check is done, you
should create a temporary pointer variable to hold the pointer of the head, so
that you don't lose the pointer to the head of the linked list while you
loop through the list to look for the current end of the list. After
that, use the temporary pointer variable to transverse through the list so
that you can locate its current end(the node whose pointer to the next node is
`NULL`) then make that end pointer to point to the new node you about
to add to the linked list.

### 4-free_list.c
To Free the allocated memory in the linked list. You have check first that
there are elements in the list that is to check that the head of the
list is not pointing to a `NULL` address. Then you need to create a pointer
variable of the node struct type that will hold the address of the current position
of the head as you loop through the list to free the individual nodes. You
transverse through the list by checking that the pointer to the next node is
not `NULL`. after the loop ends the allocated memory in the head is freed and
the head is freed.. 

### 100-first.c
To make your custom defined function to execute before the main function in C,
the GNU C Compiler (gcc) has a feature to mark custom defined functions that
should be executed before or after the `main()` function. For example if you want a custom
defined function `beforemain()` that does not return anything and does not
accept any argument __to be executed before the main function__ you can mark the function prototype like this:
```C
void beforemain(void) __attribute__ ((constructor));
```
